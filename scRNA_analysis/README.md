DATA INTEGRATION (CCA, HARMONY, LIGER) AND ANALYSIS WITH PBMC DATASETS

Here, we will be integrating closely related 3’ and 5’ PBMC datasets. 3' scRNA-seq focuses on the 3' end of transcripts, providing robust gene expression quantification. 5' scRNA-seq captures the 5' end, offering additional insights into transcription start sites and regulatory elements while also providing gene expression data.

We will use 3 data integration tools: CCA, Harmony, Liger

And the integrated dataset will be annotated using 2 methods: SingleR, ScType

I have created a database for Indian Epidemics. ER diagram was made and then ER to Relation mapping was done.
Using MySQL the tables were populated and sample queries were run.

In this file I have attached all the codes that created a website (using HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and connected it to my databse "epidemic_archive" using MySQL Workbench with php code.

The functionalities of the website include, creating a new record and deleting a record based on the ID provided.

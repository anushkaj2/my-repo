        <h1>Epidemic Archive</h1>
        <p>As humans sailed across the globe, infectious diseases have remained a steady companion throughout history. Even in this modern era of vaccines, breakthroughs, and discoveries, outbreaks like COVID-19 remind us of our limited understanding of these microbes. Despite the multitude of medical advancements, these pathogens continue to evolve. With the right mutation, many of these infectious agents resurface repeatedly. We endeavour to consolidate data on various recorded Indian epidemics through the epochs. </p>
